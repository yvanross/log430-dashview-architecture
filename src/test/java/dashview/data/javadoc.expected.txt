## `function myFunc(int one, String two, Object... three)`

This is an exemplary description and there should be no line break before this line.

But in front of this line, there should be a line break because we interpret the double newline in the source as one.

The single p-tag should force this to be preceded by a line break as well.

Wrapping in p-tags with closing tag should be possible, too, and make no difference to the single p-tag ...

Except for this text which will have a line break before, of course.
